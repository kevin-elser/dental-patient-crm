## Overview

The goal is for this to be a web application that functions as a Patient CRM for a dental practice. Though the plan is also for it to be simple
enough to be converted into a web app for other aspects of the medical field.

Plans for development and milestones reached can be found in [development_plan.md](https://github.com/kevin-elser/dental-patient-crm/blob/master/development_plan.md).

**Planned Features:**

- **Messaging & Campaigns**
  - Individual and bulk text messaging
  - Bulk emailing with dynamic templates
  - Real-time campaign analytics

- **Patient Management**
  - Dynamic, filterable patient table
  - Expandable sidebar for detailed patient information
  - Custom sublists and filtering options

- **Calendar**
  - A 24-hour day-view calendar similar to Google Calendar
  - Interactive scheduling of appointments pulled from a MySQL database (schema modeled after OpenDental)
